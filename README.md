GatherSage shows you if you can mine or pick an herb based on your current skill in that profession. It displays this information in the tooltip when you mouse over an herb in the world, or over the node on the minimap. It will also show you if that herb or mine has a chance of yielding special items (such as stone, or other piggyback herbs).

### Features

- Modifies the tooltip for mining and herbalism nodes.
- Displays title in green if you have the skill needed to harvest, red if you do not.
- Displays the amount of skill required so you know how close you are.
- Tells you if there are special items that can be harvested in addition to the obvious.
- Works on minimap nodes, so you don't have to search for one that you might not have the skill to harvest yet.
- As you gain skill, it will tell you what new herbs/mines you can gather from.
