GatherSage by Dsanai of Whisperwind
Adds skill-level and other information to gathering item tooltips.

Thanks go to EasyUnlock for portions of code that were borrowed and modified to work with Herbalism and Mining. For chests and lockboxes, get EasyUnlock! The code for notifying on skill changes was borrowed from TrainerSkills; again, a mod worth getting.
